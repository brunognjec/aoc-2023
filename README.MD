# AOC 2023

This here is just to keep track of what i learned each day.

If code is bad and there is _"bEtTer"_ and _"mOrE OpTiMiseD waY"_, shut up no body likes you and no one cares im here to learn. Dumbass.

## Day 1

```.py
f = open("case_1.txt","r")
```

this,
this is cool\
it reads .txt file

```
 d = i.translate({ord(i): None for i in 'qxabcdefghijklmnoprstuvwyz'})
```
this clears list of letters 

**DAY 1 DONE**

## Day 2
